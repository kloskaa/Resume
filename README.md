Display of Coding Experience

This is a location for me to display some of my coding practices.

Midterm (R) - This is a project that was done for my R Programming statistics course where our task was to analyze a global terrorism dataset that was posted to Kaggle.

Final Project (R) - This was the final project for my R Programming statistics coruse where we were to create a program that would automatically select the best model from a combination of variables. We then performed other analyses in the program.

Simplex Algorithms (R) - This was a voluntary project that I undertook for my Operations Research class. The code takes in a specific type of matrix and has the ability to use several different algorithms to optimize the appropriation of resources.

Mathematical Optimizations (LaTeX) - This is a portfolio/guide that I wrote for my Operations Research class. I went far beyond what was required for the class and ended up writing a miniature guide on Mathematical Opimizations. This PDF was written entirely using LaTeX and is related to the Simplex Algorithms R program.

Data Cleaning (SAS) - Cleaning data exercise prior to using for statistical analysis

FactorAnalysis, logisticRegression, merging (SAS) - Some templates that I saved from a project. Protected information has been removed from this file, so it is only for display.
