Display of Coding Experience

This is a location for me to display some of my coding practices.

Midterm (R) - This is a project that was done for my R Programming statistics course where our task was to analyze a global terrorism dataset that was posted to Kaggle.

Final Project (R) - This was the final project for my R Programming statistics coruse where we were to create a program that would automatically select the best model from a combination of variables. We then performed other analyses in the program.

Simplex Algorithms (R) - This was a voluntary project that I undertook for my Operations Research class. The code takes in a specific type of matrix and has the ability to use several different algorithms to optimize the appropriation of resources.
